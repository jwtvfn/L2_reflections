Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of a GitHub repository to your GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It creates 2 virtual branches locally origin/master and master
